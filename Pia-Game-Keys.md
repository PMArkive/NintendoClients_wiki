In LDN and LAN mode, [Pia](Pia-Overview) derives encryption keys using a game-specific key. This page lists the game-specific key for some games.

| Game | Key |
| --- | --- |
| Pokemon Sword/Shield | `p1frXqxmeCZWFv0X` |
| Splatoon 2 | `ee182a63e216cdb1f51ad4bed8cf6508` |
| Super Mario Maker 2 | `667c18475889faab61f93ef1da180971` |

Most first-party games use [ENL](ENL-Key-Generation) to derive the game-specific key.
