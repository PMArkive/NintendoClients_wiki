This page describes the protocol found in Splatoon 2. Other games probably use the same or a similar protocol. Match making is done with 'browse' packets that are sent as UDP broadcast packets through port 30000. After a connection between the consoles has been established, the [PIA protocol](PIA-Protocol) is used for further communication.

Every packet starts with a single byte that indicates its type.

## Packet types
| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | [Browse request](#0-browse-request) |
| 1 | [Browse reply](#1-browse-reply) |
| 2 | Get host request |
| 3 | Get host reply |
| 4 | Get session request |
| 5 | Get session reply |
| 6 | Keep alive message |

#### Validity flags
These flags indicate which fields have a valid value set.

| Mask | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0x1 | Minimum number of participants |
| 0x2 | Maximum number of participants |
| 0x4 | Opened only |
| 0x8 | Vacant only |
| 0x10 | Game mode |
| 0x20 | Session type |
| 0x40 | First attribute list |
| ... | ... |
| 0x800 | Last attribute list |

#### Range
| Offset | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0x0 | 2 | Minimum |
| 0x2 | 2 | Maximum |

#### Attribute list
Each attribute list may contain up to 20 attributes. Every attribute is stored as a 4-byte integer.

### Crypto Challenge
If crypto is disabled this is filled with random data. In other cases, this is a cryptographic challenge that must be correctly answered in the [browse reply](#1-browse-reply). The key is generated by AES-encrypting the key in the browse request with another game-specific key.

| Offset | Size | Description |

| 0x0 | 0x10 | Authentication tag for AES-GCM |
| 0x10 | 0x100 | Challenge (random bytes), encrypted with AES-GCM |

 The nonce for the AES-GCM algorithm is generated as follows:
