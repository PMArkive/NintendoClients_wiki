Mario Kart 8 uses less random ids to access rankings than donkey kong. Here's a list of tracks and their associated category ids. Since MK8's binary doesn't have any debug symbols, it's not exactly easy to reverse engineer the internals of the game. My way of finding the id relies on me having uploaded my highscore on my Wii U, but I didn't feel like uploading my score on every track just to fill in this list. Hence the question marks in the table below.
